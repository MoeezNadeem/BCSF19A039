        Git init commmand is used to initialize an empty git repository. This
        command creates a hidden ".git" folder in our current working
        directory.Most other Git commands are not available outside of an
        initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run
        in a new project.

        The git status command displays the state of the working directory and
        the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which
        haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output does
        not show you any information regarding the committed project history.

      <h4 class="text">
        Git add commmand is used to add untracked files to the staging index.The
        git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging
        area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file
        in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the
        repository in any significant way changes are not actually recorded
        until you run git commit. "git add . " command is used to add all the
        files in current working directory to the staging index.
